## But Why?
Often overlooked, reaction time and pattern recognition skills are essential to human life. The point of this app is to allow you to test these skills in the form of a simple game. 

## In theory
Sorting things by colour and by size is something people have to do every day. Tasks like these are often considered mundane because of their repetitive nature, and this boredom often causes a lack of concentration and mistakes. Reaction time is directly related to basic cognitive operations useful in many contexts like decision-making (Vernon, 1981). Our app, with its different games, wants to create a fun way to test these skills and improve them efficiently. 

## But How?
Similar to reaction testers used in a medical context, this app shows a pattern that has to be recognized by the user. 
Firstly, the app shows a pattern and gives the user options. That is when the test starts.
Secondly, the user analyses the pattern given and selects the most similar option. That is measured.
Thirdly, the measurements are analysed and sends off to our data collection systems [^1].
Finally, the user gets informed of their reaction time, and the test starts again.
